Need-to-have (soon):
[] Documentation
  [x] Extract docs from code
[] Type-checking up to List(a) and arrows/records
  [] "Also, we've been talking about and working on the untyped to typed
      contract installation - do we want to have some version of that
      working?"
     - contracts up to monomorphic structures and polymorphic functions

CS019 Assignments
[] Flags
[] Rocket
[x] Filesystem
[] Sortacle
[] Oracle
[] Brown Heaps
[x] Updater
[] ||ism
[] Tour Guide
[] Seam Carving (image libs)

Need-to-have (eventually):
[] Cyclic modules check
[] provide Data
[] Make everything with methods consistent with functions
  [] doc
  [] type variable declaration
[] decide on built-in exception types
[] mis-applied function error message is crap:
    p-fun-f823: contract violation
     expected: p-fun?
     given: (p-bool ...
[] Indentation enforcement?
[] better error reporting / pretty printing / support for debugging.
   For example, printing out names for brands (where appropriate)
   would be a start.

Nice-to-have (eventually):
[] More tests for keys/builtins
[] implicit cond if you start fun with a |
[] DrRacket syntax highlighting
[] Figure out how to/if we can use list.arr lists in runtime.rkt
[] currying
[] srcloc for a-any
[] Make objects retain order w.r.t syntax of literal and update

Redex
[] Redex the initial semantics
  [x] basic objects
  [] seals
  [] extending
[] Come up with a define-split-test form that makes a test run on both
   the Redex semantics and the Racket interpreter (may require a
   compile-value function over answers & exceptions...)
[] Go from Redex-generated terms to AST so we can randomly test the
   Racket implementation as well
[] add s-let and pyret compile let

HTDP:
[] surface syntax for first-class methods
[] Constructed types and brands
[] surface syntax for operators?
[] Desugar data
  [] Lock operator for immutability
  [] Brand checks on struct creation
  [x] Annotations actually checked
  [] constructed annotations actually checked
  [x] Skeleton of struct/data desugaring
[] brand names for debugging and general user-friendliness
[] pretty-printing objects
   - Take brands into account (names for them)
[] Testing libs (check/expect)

Cleanup:
[] decide on a line length and enforce
[] ordering of things in grammar vs pyret.rkt
[] consistent naming in grammar for lists of things
[] figure out what define-syntax is less boilerplate in parser.rkt
[] s-data and s-dot should agree on symbol vs. string
[] clean up runtime.rkt into more .arr definitions
[] bug report on module docs for language definitions
[] bug report on resolved-module-path? docs
[] letrec* for sequences
[] Should use a stable paren-based syntax in compile-tests rather than
   needing to update that on syntax changes
[] optional trailing commas everywhere

TODO templates:

  Adding a new piece of syntax:
  [] Add it to ast.rkt, and export it
  [] Write parser tests for the new form
  [] Add it to grammar.rkt
  [] Modify parser.rkt to parse the new syntax from grammar.rkt

  Making your new syntax functional:
  [] Write compile-tests for your new syntax (see adding new syntax)
  [] If you can desugar it entirely (this is way better):
    [] Make your changes to desugar.rkt
  [] If you cannot desugar it entirely:
    [] Figure out how to split it between desugar.rkt and compile.rkt
