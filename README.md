Setting Sail
------------

First, make sure ye've installed [Racket >= 5.3.4](http://racket-lang.org). Then run:

    $ make dep && make && make test

It'll build the Pyret compiler, run the tests, and hoist the
anchor.

When yer ready to brave the sea, run:

    $ raco pyret examples/ahoy-world.arr
