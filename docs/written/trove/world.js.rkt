  The Pyret world library is based on the universe teachpack in HtDP, and borrows much of the language for documentation. You can find documentation for the teachpack here:

        This datatype is abstract, and its implementation details (such

    This function starts a world program in the initial state specified
    by @pyret["init"]. Its behaviour is defined via the handler functions
    @pyret["handlers"]. These handler functions allow you to define various
    program behaviours: rendering, mouse and keyboard events, timed events,
    when to shut down, etc. A world specification may not contain more than
    one @secref[(tag-name "world" "to-draw")] or @secref[(tag-name "world"
    "on-tick")] handlers. This function will return the last world state
    when the stop condition is satisfied (see @secref[(tag-name "world"
    "stop-when")]) or when the canvas is closed.
  }

    Consumes a function and returns a handler that, when passed to

    key is pressed. The function is called with the current world state
    and a @secref[(tag-name "<global>" "String")] representing the pressed
    key. For most keys, this is just the corresponding single character. Some
    examples of single character strings that you may receive are @pyret{"a"},
    @pyret{"b"}, @pyret{"c"}, @pyret{" "}, @pyret{"\r"} (return/enter key),
    @pyret{"\t"} (tab key), @pyret{"\b"} (backspace). In some cases, you
    may receive multiple characters. For a full enumeration of these, you
    should reference the Racket world documentation on @hyperlink["http://docs.racket-lang.org/teachpack/2htdpuniverse.html#%28tech._world._keyevent%29"]{key events}.
