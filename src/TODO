[x] seal(obj, fields)
   - all of names must exist on obj
   - result is a seal(obj, fields), which is a mutable proxy to obj

[] make-brand()
   - produces brander and checker
   - brander used on any value, produces a brand(this-gensym, value) where
     value is a copy (of a reference to an object, or a prim)
   - checker recognizes any nested brand|seal(... brand(this-gensym, value))
     and returns true, false if it hits a non-brand value

[] consistent naming in grammar for lists of things
[] bug report on module docs

[x] make a real AST (in pyret.rkt?  before or after it?)

[] figure out what define-syntax is less boilerplate

[] keep seal() consistent with initialization/new object fields?

[] make helper for id-parsing and str-parsing in pyret.rkt

[] ordering of things in grammar vs pyret.rkt

[] decide on a line length and enforce

[] make seal into a built-in method?

Seal/lookup tests
  [x] no seal success
  [x] no seal field not found
  [x] 2 seals success
  [x] 2 seals caught by first
  [x] 2 seals caught by second

Assignment tests
  [] assignment success
  [] assignment fail
  [] assignment seal fail
  [] assignment seal success
  [] 2 seals success
  [] 2 seals caught by first
  [] 2 seals caught by second

[] add default initiliazers for all values in pyret.rkt e.g. (mknum 5)
[] applicaiton should check type better

[] resolve submoduley things with tokens and dedent errors
   - just have a pyret-tokenizer.rkt
