Redex
[] Redex the initial semantics
  [] basic objects
  [] seals
  [] extending
[] Come up with a define-split-test form that makes a test run on both
   the Redex semantics and the Racket interpreter (may require a
   compile-value function over answers & exceptions...)
[] Go from Redex-generated terms to AST so we can randomly test the
   Racket implementation as well
[] add s-let and pyret compile let

HTDP:
[] first class methods
[] Constructed types and brands
[] surface syntax for operators?
[] Desugar data
  [] Lock operator for immutability
  [] Brand checks on struct creation
  [x] Annotations actually checked
  [] constructed annotations actually checked
  [x] Skeleton of struct/data desugaring
[x] anonymous functions... :-)
[] brand names for debugging and general user-friendliness
[] pretty-printing objects
   - Take brands into account (names for them)
[x] None/null/nothing value built in
[] Lists built in
[x] How should short-circuiting booleans work?
  - do!

[] currying
[] srcloc for a-any

Cleanup:
[] decide on a line length and enforce
[] ordering of things in grammar vs pyret.rkt
[] consistent naming in grammar for lists of things
[] figure out what define-syntax is less boilerplate
[] s-data and s-dot should agree on symbol vs. string
[] clean up runtime.rkt into sanity
[] stop using typed racket except for data definitions
[] cond implicit else should be in desugar, not compile
[] bug report on module docs for language definitions
[] bug report on resolved-module-path? docs

[] application should check type better?

[] Escape into Racket with peglegs:
    !(display (current-namespace))!
  - wrapping where possible?
