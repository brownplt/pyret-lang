Here is an example blog post.

Everything after this paragraph "after the break". On index pages and
Atom feeds, it will become "Continue reading...", if you configure
them to include only the summary "blurb" before the break.

## Code blocks

Frog optionally uses [Pygments](http://pygments.org/) if it's
installed to do syntax highlighting. In your markdown using backtick
code blocks you can specify a language:

    ```language
    some racket code
    ```

That name is given to Pygments as the lexer to use.

For example this:

    ```js
    /**
     * Some JavaScript
     */
    function foo()
    {
        if (counter <= 10)
            return;
        // it works!
    ```

Yields this:

```js
/**
 * Some JavaScript
 */
function foo()
{
    if (counter <= 10)
        return;
    // it works!
```

And this:

    ```racket
    #lang racket
    ;; Finds Racket sources in all subdirs
    (for ([path (in-directory)])
      (when (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" path)
        (printf "source file: ~a\n" path)))
    (symbol->string 'foo)
    ```

Yields this:

```racket
#lang racket
;; Finds Racket sources in all subdirs
(for ([path (in-directory)])
  (when (regexp-match? #rx"[.]rkt$" path)
    (printf "source file: ~a\n" path)))
(symbol->string 'foo)
```

Notice that, for Racket, symbols with unambiguous documentation
(provided by one library, or provided by several where one is `racket`
or `racket/base`) are links to that documentation.

This also works outside fenced code blocks, for symbols in backticks
immediately followed by `[racket]`. Example: `printf`[racket]. This
isn't official Markdown; it's simply a pun on link syntax and fenced
code block languages. This is similar to using `@racket[printf]` in
Scribble.

`symbol->string`[racket].

Here is a lambda: λ.

Here is a lambda in code backticks: `λ`.

And here in indented code block:

    (λ () #t)

And here in fenced code block, no lang specified:

```
(λ () #t)
```

And here in fenced code block, lang = `racket`:

```racket
(λ () #t)
```

And here in fenced code block, lang = `scheme`:

```scheme
(λ () #t)
```

Here's a simple `for` macro, written in [Racket][define-syntax-rule]:

```racket
(define-syntax-rule (for (x e1) e2)
  (for-each (λ (x) e2) e1))
```

The end.
