This module is designed to gauge the performance of register 
allocation by way of measuring activation record sizes. Note that
the underlying assumption of this module is that phase 0 does NOT 
have any register allocation abilities (or, at least, phase A has
more).

NOTE: These test can only be run on Unix-like systems currently.
